Fake Bill Detection with R/Python

This project focuses on building a model to detect counterfeit bills using machine learning techniques. You'll apply various data science skills, including data analysis, model building, and result presentation.
 
Key Skills Acquired:

    Data Classification: Implementing automated classification algorithms to detect counterfeit bills.
    Predictive Analysis: Developing predictive models to forecast the likelihood of a bill being fake.
    Linear Regression: Using linear regression techniques to understand relationships within data.
    Logistic Regression: Applying logistic regression for binary classification tasks (fake vs. real).
    Data Presentation: Communicating your findings effectively to stakeholders through clear, actionable insights.

Technologies Used:

    Python / R: Data processing, model building, and analysis.
    Scikit-learn: For building classification models and performing regression analysis.
    Pandas / NumPy: Data manipulation and preparation.
    Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization to interpret model results.
